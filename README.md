This is the first version of IFE JS Library. It's just a first version, so major changes in future versions can be expected.

## How to use

### Prerequisites
  1.- In the HTML where you need to IFE to appear you have to insert some HTML and Javascript variables. You can find them in the "demoindex.html" file:
    * simpaticoEservice variable definition
    * The loading of simpatico.js itself
    * The simpatico_top div to write Simpatico toolbar
    * Google Oauth code in case you need Google authentication

  2.- You must have installed Citizenpedia in order to retrieve questions and terms

  3.- In simpatico.js you must declare the base url where the Citizenpedia is installed so the api calls work.
